    <h2>Bugs in Magellan</h2>

    <p>For us as developers the error messages are a good start when
        tackling a problem. These can be found in the <tt>errors.txt</tt> file in
        the Magellan folder; please include these error messages if you
        have a problem with Magellan. To reproduce an error it may prove
        necessary to send in (an excerpt of) the used CR. These CRs are
        of course handled confidentially, and will be deleted after the
        issue has been resolved.</p>

        Please refer to this page if you want to report errors: <a
            href="https://magellan2.github.io/bugs">https://magellan2.github.io/bugs</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Feature wishes = further development</h3>

    <p>We try to develop Magellan according to the wishes of its
        users. Our bug tracker helps enormously in this, because all
        feature wishes are centrally and publicly available.</p>
