        <h3>
          What is Magellan 2.x?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Magellan 2.x is an logical progression of the Magellan
          clients. The changes in the software were so extensive, that 
          we decided, to give it a new much higher version number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Magellan 2.x needs, in comparison to Magellan 1.x now Java5 (1.5.0 or
          higher). Additionally it is now a JAR file that has a setup that
          unpacks and installs a whole application on your computer. The application
          is now split into multiple files. So you're able to change texts
          and icons as you want.

        </p>
        <p>
          Magellan 2.x offers also some new features. With the help of the
          Infonode Docking Framework you can now customize your Magellan
          desktop as you want and as you need with a single mouse click.
          You don't need to edit any configuration files any more.
          Furthermore Magellan 2.x has now a split code structure and
          makes it possible to develop server or console applications without
          a graphical user interface.
